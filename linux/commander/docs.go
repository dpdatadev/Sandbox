COMMANDER (?) still picking the name
https://chatgpt.com/c/698c0190-d8ec-832d-8aee-537b6c64320d

February 2026 - R&D

Containerized testing:
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go
https://medium.com/tiket-com/go-with-cucumber-an-introduction-for-bdd-style-integration-testing-7aca2f2879e4

We can setup containers, configured to our liking, describe the scenarios exactly with Cucumber,
then test each of our pipeline components. SSH, HTTP, SQLITE, YAML, etc., and not have a messy server circus.

Paying homage to https://github.com/alexellis/go-execute
Notes, 2/11 - thinking of creating a new command API/service for Linux
servers. To have diagnostic and automated activities embedded in various applications.
For use with my raspberry pi's in the beginning. Do more research on this**.

v 1.1 - Redis/Cache Command support(?)
Chain of Command
github/dpdatadev/chain-of-command
“Composable command execution framework with persistence, security controls, and pipeline orchestration.”
REDIS BACKED, HTTP2 streaming, ACID compliant, process management and remote execution with policy enforcement. (??)
1) Command identity + audit trail

Each command becomes a first-class entity:

2) Persistence layer

Your CommandStore abstraction enables:

SQLite → local dev

Postgres → production

Redis → caching / queues

This converts ephemeral execution into:

Durable execution history

Companies building:

CI/CD tools

Remote agents

Fleet orchestration

Security audit systems

…all need this.

3) Security scrubber / policy engine

os/exec will happily run:

rm -rf /
sudo shutdown now


Your scrubber introduces:

Blocklists

Regex policies

Allowlists

Role-based execution

Now your framework becomes viable for:

SaaS agents

Remote automation

Multi-tenant systems


Yes, os/exec supports pipes…

…but only at the file descriptor level.

You’re abstracting at the semantic level:

SSH: https://github.com/appleboy/easyssh-proxy

sshCmd.
  Pipe(textCmd).
  Pipe(fileCmd).
  Pipe(httpCmd).
  Execute(ctx)


  Now pipelines can cross protocols:

Source	Destination
SSH	Local shell
Shell	File
HTTP	Parser
File	Database

This is beyond Unix pipes.

It’s execution graphs.


TextCommand   → local shell
SSHCommand    → remote shell
HTTPCommand   → REST call
FileCommand   → write/read
SQLCommand    → database


ExecChain is a composable command execution framework for Go that extends os/exec with persistence, security policies, and multi-protocol pipelines.

Track, audit, and chain shell, SSH, HTTP, and file commands into reproducible execution graphs — with Redis caching and database storage built in.

pipeline := cmdforge.NewPipeline()

pipeline.
    SSH(sshConfig, "journalctl", []string{"-n", "500"}).
    PipeLocal("grep", []string{"ERROR"}).
    PipeHTTPPost("https://ops.internal/logs").
    PipeFile("error_report.txt")

pipeline.Run(ctx)

Different taglines:

“Embedded command orchestration framework with remote execution agents.”

A programmable command orchestration + audit + pipeline system with multi-protocol execution (shell, SSH, HTTP, file, DB) and persistence.

If RunDeck and Ansible had a baby .. but it came out as an embeddable API for Dev teams.


This framework becomes compelling when:

Command execution is part of the product

Not just an operational concern

DevOps handles:

Deploying systems

Embedded orchestration handles:

Operating systems programmatically from within software

Different layers of the stack.

Implements the Chain of Responsibility design pattern:
https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility/go/example

There are no rogue commands - must be handled in the context of Execution manager,
which validates, scrubs, executes, and handles directed output and logging.
Each component hands off to the next.
Command → Scrubber → Policy Engine → Logger → Executor → Post-Processor → Store

2/15
Post-Processor (Handlers?, this could be a tie into any app or process for Data Extraction/Analysis etc.,)
Processing the data is the responsiblity of another framework or user code and doesn't belong in the framework(maybe)

Study this pattern*
